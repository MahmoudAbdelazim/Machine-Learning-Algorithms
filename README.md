# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This repository contains my machine learning algorithms implementations during the machine learning course in college.


## Content:

### 1- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/MahmoudAbdelazim/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/tree/main/1-%20Linear%20Regression)

A simple linear regression model in Python from scratch that predicts house prices
based on the square foot living feature, using only NumPy and Pandas.


### 2- [Multi-Variable Linear Regression](https://github.com/MahmoudAbdelazim/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/tree/main/2-%20Multi-Variable%20Linear%20Regression)

A multi-variable linear regression model in Python from scratch that predicts house prices 
based on 4 features, using only NumPy and Pandas.


### 3- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/MahmoudAbdelazim/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/tree/main/3-%20Logistic%20Regression)

A simple logistic regression model in Python from scratch that predicts whether a person has
heart disease based on multiple features, using only NumPy and Pandas.


### 4- [Decision Tree](https://github.com/MahmoudAbdelazim/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/tree/main/4-%20Decision%20Tree)

A complete implementation of a decision tree structure for a classifier model that predicts the
political party of US congress members based on their votes in multiple features, implemented in Python from scratch using only NumPy and Pandas.


### 5- [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/MahmoudAbdelazim/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/tree/main/5-%20Support%20Vector%20Machine)

A support vector machine model in Python from scrach that predicts whether a person has a heart disease, 
using only NumPy and Pandas.

### 6- [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/MahmoudAbdelazim/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/tree/main/6-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Network)

A MNIST dataset classifier model in Python that classifies handwritten-digit images to their corresponding digits using different number of convolutional layers and pooling layers, built using TensorFlow Keras.

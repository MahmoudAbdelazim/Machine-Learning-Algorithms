# Logistic Regression
### Problem statement:
The attached dataset "heart.csv" contains 303 records of patients have heart disease or not according
to features in it. 


1. Apply Logistic Regression model using gradient descent to
predict whether patient have heart disease or not (target) based on 4 predictors (trestbps, chol,
thalach, oldpeak). 
2. Implement the gradient descent function to optimize parameters of the function.
3. Calculate error function at each iteration to see how the error changes.
4. Use optimized hypothesis function to make predictions on new data.

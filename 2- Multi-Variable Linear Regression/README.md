# Multi-Variable Linear Regression
### Problem statement:
The attached dataset "house_data.csv" contains 21613 records of house sale prices. 
It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.


1. Apply simple multiple linear regression with gradient descent to predict the price based on 5 predictors (grade, bathrooms, lat, sqft_living, view). 
2. Implement the gradient descent function to optimize parameters of the function.
3. Calculate error function at each iteration to see how the error changes using the Mean Squared Error.
4. Use optimized hypothesis function to make predictions on new data.
